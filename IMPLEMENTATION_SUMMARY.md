# Brain Visualization App - Survey Integration Implementation Summary

## What Was Built

I've successfully created a survey integration system that automatically highlights brain regions based on trauma questionnaire responses, exactly as you requested.

## Key Features Implemented

### 1. **Integrated Brain Survey Component** (`IntegratedBrainSurvey.jsx`)
- Takes survey results and maps them to specific brain regions
- Automatically highlights affected regions with color-coded impact levels:
  - ðŸ”´ Red: Severe impact (80%+)
  - ðŸŸ  Orange: High impact (60-80%)
  - ðŸŸ¡ Yellow: Moderate impact (40-60%)
  - ðŸŸ¢ Green: Mild impact (below 40%)
- Two view modes:
  - **Impact View**: Shows regions sorted by severity
  - **Timeline View**: Groups impacts by age when trauma occurred

### 2. **Neurable EEG Integration** (`NeurableIntegration.jsx`)
- Connects to Neurable MW75 headphones
- Records 6-channel EEG data (Fp1, Fp2, T3, T4, O1, O2)
- Analyzes brain waves for trauma markers:
  - Reduced alpha waves â†’ Emotional dysregulation
  - Elevated beta waves â†’ Hypervigilance
  - Hemispheric asymmetry â†’ Trauma indicators
- Real-time visualization of EEG data

### 3. **Combined Analysis Dashboard** (`CombinedBrainAnalysis.jsx`)
- Merges survey data (70% weight) with EEG data (30% weight)
- Three analysis modes:
  - Survey-only view
  - EEG-only view
  - Combined view with comprehensive analysis
- Provides personalized recommendations based on both data sources

### 4. **Enhanced Trauma Mapping**
- Updated mapping system to process survey answers directly
- Duration multipliers adjust impact based on how long trauma lasted
- Developmental period vulnerabilities considered
- Gender-specific vulnerabilities included
- Protective factors reduce overall impact by 15%

## How It Works

1. **User completes trauma survey** â†’ System analyzes which ACEs they experienced
2. **Mapping to brain regions** â†’ Each trauma type affects specific brain areas
3. **Automatic highlighting** â†’ Affected regions shown in real brain viewers
4. **Optional EEG addition** â†’ Can record brain activity for enhanced analysis
5. **Combined insights** â†’ Both historical trauma and current brain state

## Brain Regions Tracked

- **Amygdala**: Fear processing (physical abuse, violence)
- **Hippocampus**: Memory (chronic stress, sexual abuse)
- **Prefrontal Cortex**: Executive control (emotional neglect)
- **Anterior Cingulate**: Emotion regulation (various traumas)
- **Temporal Regions**: Sensory processing
- **Occipital Regions**: Visual processing
- Plus 20+ other anatomical regions

## Deployment

## Next Steps

You can now:
1. Have people take the survey
2. See their brain regions automatically highlighted
3. Optionally add Neurable EEG data for real-time analysis
4. Export results for therapeutic use

This directly addresses your vision: "when people answer my survey it will automatically highlight different parts of the brain that are impacted and how those brain regions are altered."
