# âœ… Brain Model Successfully Installed

**Date:** October 5, 2025
**Status:** READY

---

## Installation Complete

The brain 3D model has been successfully installed:

- **File:** `/public/models/brain-labeled.glb`
- **Size:** 8.4 MB
- **Model:** "Brain - with labeled parts" by AbdulMuhaymin
- **License:** Creative Commons Attribution (CC-BY)

## Next Steps

1. **Refresh your browser** - Go to http://localhost:5173/ and hard refresh (Cmd+Shift+R on Mac, Ctrl+F5 on Windows)

2. **Load the demo** - Click "Load Demo (ACE Score 10)" to see the visualization with real brain anatomy

3. **Navigate to Visualization** - Click the "Visualization" tab

You should now see a realistic 3D brain model with:
- Anatomical brain structure (gyri and sulci)
- Color-coded impact markers
- Proper brain regions labeled
- Interactive 3D controls

## What Changed

**Before (what you saw in the screenshot):**
- Abstract geometric shapes (sphere + wireframe hemisphere)
- Very basic fallback visualization
- No anatomical accuracy

**Now (what you should see):**
- Detailed anatomical brain mesh
- Realistic cortical surface with folds
- Subcortical structures visible
- Professional medical visualization quality

## Troubleshooting

If you still see the abstract shapes:

1. **Hard refresh the browser** (Cmd+Shift+R or Ctrl+F5)
2. **Clear browser cache** if needed
3. **Check browser console** for any loading errors
4. **Verify file exists:**
   ```bash
   ls -lh public/models/brain-labeled.glb
   ```
