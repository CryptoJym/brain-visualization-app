# Brain Visualization Deployment Fix Tasks

## Current Issue
The brain visualization app deploys successfully to Vercel but the 3D brain map does not load correctly in production.

## Key Information
- **Repository**: https://github.com/CryptoJym/brain-visualization-app
- **Deployment URL**: https://brain-visualization-app.vercel.app/
- **Issue**: Three-brain library (2.3MB) not loading properly on production
- **Local Status**: Works perfectly on local development
- **Build Status**: No TypeScript errors, builds successfully

## Specific Tasks for CrewAI

### 1. Deployment Analysis
- Check if `/libs/threebrain-main.js` is accessible on production
- Verify CORS headers and security policies
- Analyze network requests in production
- Check for path resolution differences between dev and prod

### 2. Code Fixes Required
- Update `PersonalizedThreeBrain.jsx` script loading mechanism
- Consider using dynamic imports or async loading
- Add proper error handling and loading states
- Ensure library initialization happens after DOM is ready

### 3. Build Configuration
- Verify `vite.config.js` properly handles large assets
- Check `vercel.json` for proper static file serving
- Ensure public directory is correctly copied during build
- Add necessary headers for JavaScript files

### 4. Alternative Solutions
- Consider hosting three-brain library on CDN
- Bundle the library differently
- Use Vercel's edge functions if needed
- Implement progressive loading strategy

## Success Criteria
1. Brain visualization loads correctly on production
2. No console errors related to library loading
3. All interactive features work (rotation, zoom, region selection)
4. Performance is acceptable (loads within 3 seconds)
5. Works across major browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Safari)

## Memory Storage Requirements
All findings, code changes, and solutions should be stored in MEM0 with proper categorization for future reference.
