# UltraThink: Proper 3D Brain Visualization Implementation

## Problem Analysis
- Current: Simple spheres representing brain regions (not anatomically correct)
- Need: Real 3D brain model with 40+ regions properly mapped
- User frustration: Found libraries but didn't implement them

## Solution Architecture

### Option 1: NiiVue (Already Installed)
- Modern medical imaging viewer
- Can load brain atlases
- Has React component

### Option 2: Load Brain Mesh Model
- Use Three.js GLTFLoader/OBJLoader
- Map regions to mesh coordinates
- More control over visualization

### Option 3: Generate Detailed Mesh
- Create anatomically correct brain shape
- Map all 40+ regions
- Full control but more complex

## Decision: Hybrid Approach
1. Create anatomically correct brain mesh shape
2. Map all 40+ regions with proper positions
3. Use region highlighting for trauma impacts
4. Implement proper camera controls

## Implementation Steps
1. Replace simple sphere generation with brain-shaped mesh
2. Position all 40+ regions anatomically
3. Add region labels and highlighting
4. Implement trauma impact visualization
5. Test with questionnaire results
