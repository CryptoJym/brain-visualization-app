# Brain Visualization Improvement Plan

## Current Status (2025-01-10)

### Fixed Issues ✅
1. **Demo bug**: Demo now correctly shows ACE score of 10 (was showing zeros)
2. **Double cortex layer**: Removed by switching to wireframe mode
3. **Visual clutter**: Reduced cortex opacity to 0.15, removed sulci lines
4. **Marker visibility**: Increased marker size significantly (0.25 + magnitude/150)

### Remaining Issues ❌
1. **Not anatomically accurate**: Using geometric primitives (spheres, cylinders) instead of real brain anatomy
2. **Hard to comprehend**: Average person can't tell what they're looking at
3. **Region positioning**: Guessed coordinates, not based on actual brain atlas
4. **No labels**: Brain regions not labeled, unclear what markers represent
5. **Visual delineation**: Hard to distinguish between different altered regions and their impacts

## Required Resources for 95% Comprehension

### 1. Anatomically Accurate 3D Brain Model (CRITICAL)
**Current Problem**: Geometric primitives don't look like a real brain

**What's Needed**:
- Open-source brain mesh file (GLB, OBJ, or STL format)
- Should include separate meshes for:
  - Cortex surface (with realistic gyri/sulci)
  - Subcortical structures (thalamus, basal ganglia)
  - Cerebellum
  - Brainstem
  - Limbic structures (amygdala, hippocampus)

**Potential Sources**:
- NIH 3D Print Exchange (https://3dprint.nih.gov/)
- Allen Brain Atlas (https://alleninstitute.org/)
- BrainBrowser project (https://brainbrowser.cbrain.mcgill.ca/)
- SketchFab Creative Commons medical models
- Open Anatomy Project
- FreeSurfer average brain templates

**Loading Method**: THREE.GLTFLoader or THREE.OBJLoader

---

### 2. Brain Region Coordinate Atlas
**Current Problem**: Region positions are estimated/guessed

**What's Needed**:
- MNI152 template coordinates OR Talairach coordinates
- JSON/CSV mapping region names to 3D coordinates
- Exists in neuroimaging software (FSL, SPM, FreeSurfer)

**Example Format**:
```json
{
  "Amygdala_L": {"x": -25, "y": -5, "z": -20, "size": 1500},
  "Hippocampus_L": {"x": -28, "y": -21, "z": -18, "size": 4000},
  "Prefrontal_Cortex_L": {"x": -10, "y": 45, "z": 25, "size": 15000}
}
```

**Coordinate System**: MNI152 (Montreal Neurological Institute) is standard in neuroimaging

---

### 3. Development/Debugging Tools

**Three.js Inspector** (Chrome extension):
- Inspect scene graph in real-time
- Toggle mesh visibility
- View exact positions, scales, materials
- Debug overlapping geometry

**Alternative**: Use dat.GUI or leva for runtime controls:
```javascript
import { useControls } from 'leva';

const controls = useControls({
  cortexOpacity: { value: 0.15, min: 0, max: 1, step: 0.05 },
  markerSize: { value: 0.25, min: 0.1, max: 1, step: 0.05 },
  showCortex: true,
  showSubcortical: true
});
```

---

### 4. Interactive Labels/Annotations

**Text Labels**:
- Use CSS3DRenderer for HTML labels in 3D space
- Or troika-three-text for performant 3D text
- Or sprite-based text with canvas textures

**Leader Lines**:
- Connect markers to floating labels
- Use THREE.Line with dashed material
- Position labels outside brain for clarity

**Example Libraries**:
- `troika-three-text` - High-performance SDF text rendering
- `drei` (React Three Fiber helpers) - Has `<Html>` component for labels
- `three-bmfont-text` - Bitmap font rendering

---

### 5. Reference Visualizations to Study

**Existing Medical Visualization Tools**:
1. **BrainBrowser** (https://brainbrowser.cbrain.mcgill.ca/)
   - Open-source, web-based
   - Shows how to load brain meshes
   - Good example of region highlighting

2. **Niivue** (https://github.com/niivue/niivue)
   - Modern WebGL neuroimaging viewer
   - Handles NIFTI files, meshes, overlays
   - Excellent rendering quality

3. **3D Brain** (http://www.g2conline.org/3dbrain)
   - Interactive brain with region selection
   - Good UI/UX reference
   - Clear visual language

4. **Allen Brain Atlas 3D Reference Atlas**
   - Gold standard for anatomical accuracy
   - Region coordinate reference

---

## Immediate Implementation Steps (No New Resources)

Can improve comprehension immediately by:

### 1. Add Text Labels to Markers
```javascript
// Using CSS3DRenderer
import { CSS3DRenderer, CSS3DObject } from 'three/examples/jsm/renderers/CSS3DRenderer.js';

const labelDiv = document.createElement('div');
labelDiv.className = 'brain-label';
labelDiv.textContent = 'Amygdala (Severe)';
labelDiv.style.color = 'white';
labelDiv.style.fontSize = '14px';

const label = new CSS3DObject(labelDiv);
label.position.copy(markerPosition);
label.position.y += 0.5; // Float above marker
scene.add(label);
```

### 2. Persistent Color Legend
- Always visible legend panel
- Shows: Red/Orange = Hyperactivation, Blue = Hypoactivity
- Include severity scale (Subtle → Notable → Moderate → Severe)

### 3. Enhanced Hover Information
- Show region name in large text
- Display exact impact value
- List all ACEs affecting this region
- Show mitigation from protective factors

### 4. Exploded View Mode
- Button to separate hemispheres (move apart on X-axis)
- Makes internal structures more visible
- User can toggle between normal and exploded view

### 5. Cutaway/Slice View
- Add clipping planes to "cut away" cortex
- Reveal internal structures (limbic system)
- Slider to control clipping plane position

## Long-term Implementation (With Resources)

### Phase 1: Load Real Brain Mesh
1. Obtain GLB/OBJ brain model
2. Replace geometric primitives with loaded mesh
3. Apply appropriate materials and textures
4. Ensure proper scaling and orientation

### Phase 2: Accurate Region Positioning
1. Load MNI152 coordinate atlas
2. Map region names to coordinates
3. Position markers at exact anatomical locations
4. Verify against neuroanatomy references

### Phase 3: Professional Annotations
1. Implement troika-three-text or CSS3D labels
2. Add leader lines from markers to labels
3. Create expandable info panels for each region
4. Add anatomical orientation markers (Anterior/Posterior, etc.)

### Phase 4: Educational Features
1. Add "Tour" mode that highlights regions sequentially
2. Implement comparison view (normal brain vs. trauma-affected)
3. Add timeline animation showing age-related impacts
4. Create printable report with 3D snapshots

## Success Criteria for 95% Comprehension

An average person should be able to:

1. ✅ **Immediately recognize it as a brain** (requires real mesh)
2. ✅ **Identify specific brain regions** (requires labels)
3. ✅ **Understand what red vs blue means** (requires legend + education)
4. ✅ **See which regions are most affected** (size/color coding)
5. ✅ **Understand the connections between regions** (pathways with labels)
6. ✅ **Know what caused each impact** (hover/click reveals ACE source)
7. ✅ **See the difference between types of trauma** (color-coded by category)
8. ✅ **Understand severity levels** (clear visual hierarchy)

---

## Files Modified (Current Session)

1. `/src/utils/demoData.js` - Created demo data with ACE score 10
2. `/src/components/OfficialACEsQuestionnaire.jsx` - Added demo button + fixed calculation
3. `/src/utils/anatomicalBrainGeometry.js` - Switched cortex to wireframe
4. `/src/components/visualization/InteractiveBrainVisualization.jsx` - Increased marker size

---

## Next Agent Tasks

1. **Research & Acquire**: Find open-source anatomically accurate brain mesh (GLB/OBJ)
2. **Research & Acquire**: Find MNI152 or Talairach coordinate atlas (JSON/CSV)
3. **Implement**: Replace geometric primitives with real brain mesh
4. **Implement**: Add text labels to all brain region markers
5. **Implement**: Create persistent color legend UI
6. **Implement**: Add enhanced hover tooltips with detailed info
7. **Test**: Verify average person can understand visualization (user testing)
8. **Iterate**: Refine based on feedback until 95% comprehension achieved

---

## Technical Debt / Known Issues

1. Demo calculation code is duplicated (should refactor calculateResults to accept data param)
2. Cortex wireframe still creates slight visual confusion (needs real mesh)
3. No region labels - users don't know what they're looking at
4. Pathway tubes are thick but unlabeled - unclear what connections mean
5. No legend showing what colors represent
6. No anatomical orientation indicators (front/back/left/right)
7. Markers cluster together in center - need accurate positioning

---

## Questions for Decision

1. **Which brain atlas to use?** MNI152 (standard) or Talairach (older but widely documented)?
2. **Mesh detail level?** High-poly (realistic but slower) or low-poly (faster but less detailed)?
3. **Label strategy?** CSS3D overlays or 3D text meshes or sprite textures?
4. **Interactive features priority?** Focus on clarity first, or add tours/animations?
5. **Mobile support?** Optimize for desktop first, or ensure mobile compatibility?

**Status**: Ready for next agent to research brain mesh sources and coordinate atlases.
