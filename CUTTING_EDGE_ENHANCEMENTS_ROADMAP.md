- Therapist access requires explicit consent
- Community interactions are anonymous by default

## Next Immediate Steps

1. Complete biometric integration with webcam permissions
2. Design healing pathway content structure
3. Set up longitudinal data schema in Supabase
4. Create UI mockups for new features
5. Begin user testing with current features

## Vision Statement

We're building more than an assessment tool - we're creating a comprehensive healing ecosystem that makes the invisible impacts of trauma visible, the unchangeable changeable, and the journey from trauma to healing a supported, measurable, and hopeful process.

By combining cutting-edge technology with deep empathy and scientific rigor, we're democratizing access to trauma-informed care and creating a future where understanding and healing from trauma is accessible to everyone.
