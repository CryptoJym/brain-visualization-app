# Brain Visualization App - Major Update

## Memory for mem0

Brain visualization app major update completed. Removed severity calculations (no more 8 ACEs = 8/10). Now counts total ACEs (35+ questions including near-death experiences, being trapped, etc). Added dropdown selectors for age/duration. Shows brain regions affected by developmental period, not severity scores. 40+ brain regions mapped. Found open-source 3D brain libraries: BrainBrowser, NiiVue, Allen Brain Atlas for anatomically correct visualization. Deployed to https://brain-visualization-o962v6kjo-utlyze.vercel.app
