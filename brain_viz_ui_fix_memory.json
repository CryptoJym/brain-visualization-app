  "title": "Brain Visualization App - Demo vs Real Assessment Fixed",
  "date": "2025-07-13",
  "project": "brain-visualization-app",
  "type": "bug_fix",
  "category": "UI/UX",
  "importance": "high",
  "problem": {
    "user_complaint": "Why is the demo different than the final result?",
    "issue": "Demo showed custom SVG brain visualization with colored regions, but real assessment just displayed embedded iframes from external websites (BrainFacts.org)",
    "user_frustration": "I was looking for something that I could use for people to better understand their Traumatized brain to see the different brain parts, and I want to actually look like a goddamn brain"
  },
  "solution": {
    "summary": "Created PersonalizedBrainMap component that uses BrainCanvas for actual brain visualization",
    "changes": [
      "Replaced IntegratedBrainSurvey (iframe-based) with PersonalizedBrainMap in App.jsx",
      "Now both demo and real assessment show proper brain visualizations",
      "Brain regions are colored based on trauma impact severity (red=severe, orange=high, yellow=moderate, green=mild)",
      "Users can click regions for details, view impact/timeline modes, and export their brain map"
    ],
    "key_files_updated": [

      "/Users/jamesbrady/brain-visualization-app/src/components/CombinedBrainAnalysis.jsx (line 173)"

  "result": "The app now shows an anatomically-inspired brain with regions that light up based on survey responses",
