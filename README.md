## üß¨ Brain Regions & Trauma Mapping

### Primary Regions Analyzed
- **Amygdala**: Threat detection, fear response, emotional memory
- **Hippocampus**: Memory consolidation, stress hormone regulation, spatial processing
- **Prefrontal Cortex**: Executive function, emotional regulation, decision-making
- **Anterior Cingulate Cortex**: Emotion processing, attention, social awareness
- **Insula**: Interoception, empathy, self-awareness
- **Thalamus**: Sensory relay, consciousness, sleep regulation
- **Brain Stem**: Survival responses, autonomic functions
- **Corpus Callosum**: Inter-hemispheric communication and integration

### Trauma-Specific Mappings
- **Physical Abuse**: Hyperactive amygdala, reduced prefrontal control
- **Emotional Neglect**: Underdeveloped insula, attachment system disruption
- **Sexual Abuse**: Altered sensory processing, dissociation pathways
- **Chronic Stress**: Hippocampal atrophy, HPA axis dysregulation
- **Early Loss**: Attachment system changes, altered reward processing

## üîí Privacy & Security

- **Local Processing**: All biometric data analyzed on-device
- **End-to-End Encryption**: Peer communications use Signal protocol
- **Zero-Knowledge Architecture**: We never see your assessment data
- **HIPAA Compliant**: Designed for clinical use (pending certification)
- **Data Ownership**: You own and control all your data
