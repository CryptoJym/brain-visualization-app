# Brain Visualization - Neuroscience of Adversity

An interactive 3D visualization showing how childhood trauma shapes neural development. This educational tool demonstrates the impact of adverse experiences on different brain regions and their interconnections.

## Features

- **Interactive 3D Brain Model**: Rotate and explore a scientifically-informed brain visualization
- **Clickable Brain Regions**: Learn about specific areas like the amygdala, hippocampus, and prefrontal cortex
- **Neural Connections**: Visualize how different brain regions communicate and interact
- **Trauma Impact Timeline**: See how experiences at different ages affect brain development
- **Mobile Responsive**: Works on desktop, tablet, and mobile devices

## Technology Stack

- React 18
- Three.js for 3D graphics
- Tailwind CSS for styling
- Vite for fast development and building

## Installation

```bash
npm install
```

## Development

```bash
npm run dev
```

## Build for Production

```bash
npm run build
```

## Deployment

This project is configured for deployment on Vercel. Simply connect your GitHub repository to Vercel and it will automatically deploy.

## Brain Regions Included

- **Amygdala**: Threat detection and emotional processing
- **Hippocampus**: Memory formation and stress regulation
- **Prefrontal Cortex**: Executive function and emotional regulation
- **Corpus Callosum**: Inter-hemispheric communication
- **Visual Cortex**: Visual processing and pattern recognition
- **Auditory Cortex**: Sound and language processing
- **Visual-Limbic Pathway**: Direct connection between visual input and emotional centers

## Educational Purpose

This visualization is designed to help people understand:
- How childhood experiences shape brain development
- The neurological basis of trauma responses
- Why certain behaviors emerge from specific neural changes
- The interconnected nature of brain systems
