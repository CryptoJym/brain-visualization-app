BRAIN VISUALIZATION APP - UI FIX MEMORY
Date: 2025-07-13

PROBLEM FIXED:
User complained: "Why is the demo different than the final result?"
- Demo showed custom SVG brain visualization with colored regions
- Real assessment just showed embedded iframes from BrainFacts.org
- User wanted something that "actually looks like a goddamn brain"

SOLUTION IMPLEMENTED:
- Created PersonalizedBrainMap component using BrainCanvas for real brain visualization
- Replaced IntegratedBrainSurvey (iframe-based) with PersonalizedBrainMap in App.jsx
- Now both demo and real assessment show proper brain visualizations
- Brain regions are colored by trauma impact severity:
  * Red = Severe impact
  * Orange = High impact  
  * Yellow = Moderate impact
  * Green = Mild impact
- Users can click regions for details, switch between impact/timeline modes, and export their brain map

KEY FILES UPDATED:
- /Users/jamesbrady/brain-visualization-app/src/App.jsx (line 192)
- /Users/jamesbrady/brain-visualization-app/src/components/CombinedBrainAnalysis.jsx (line 173)

RESULT: The app now shows an anatomically-inspired brain with regions that light up based on survey responses, matching what was shown in the demo.
