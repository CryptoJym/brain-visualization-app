# Brain Model Loading Fix Summary

## Issue
The brain model was stuck at 0% loading and not progressing.

## Root Causes
1. The animation loop was checking `isLoading` state from the initial render, which would always be `true`
2. Missing cleanup for the loading timeout in useEffect
3. Potential null reference errors in the animation loop

## Fixes Applied

### 1. Fixed Animation Start Logic
- Changed from conditional start based on `isLoading` to immediate start
- The animation loop now runs continuously, rendering an empty scene until content loads

### 2. Added Proper Cleanup
- Added `clearTimeout(loadingTimeout)` to useEffect cleanup
- Added null checks for renderer and animation ID before cleanup

### 3. Improved Error Handling
- Added null checks in animation loop for mesh properties
- Reset loading error state when starting a new load
- Added better error display in loading screen

### 4. Code Changes
```javascript
// Before:
if (!isLoading) {
  animate();
}

// After:
animate(); // Start immediately

// Added safety checks:
if (mesh && mesh.userData && mesh.userData.isImpacted) {
  // ... animation code
}

// Added proper cleanup:
clearTimeout(loadingTimeout);
```

## Result
The brain visualization now loads properly with:
- Progress indicator showing actual loading progress
- Fallback brain model displaying correctly
- Smooth transition from loading to interactive visualization
- No more stuck at 0% issue
