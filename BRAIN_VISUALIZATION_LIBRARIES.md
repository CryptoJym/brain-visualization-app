# Open-Source 3D Brain Visualization Options

## Recommended Solutions

### 1. BrainBrowser (Best for Quick Implementation)
- WebGL-based using Three.js
- Supports brain atlases with labeled regions
- Simple integration (5-10 lines of code)
- Developed by McGill Centre for Integrative Neuroscience
- GitHub: https://github.com/aces/brainbrowser

### 2. NiiVue (Modern TypeScript Option)
- WebGL2-based medical image viewer
- Supports 30+ formats
- React/Vue components available
- Active development
- GitHub: https://github.com/niivue/niivue

### 3. Allen Brain Atlas API
- Comprehensive brain region data (1,675+ specimens)
- JavaScript API available
- Includes all regions you need (dlPFC, vmPFC, etc.)
- https://atlas.brain-map.org/

### 4. vtk.js (High Performance)
- Powerful scientific visualization
- WebGL/WebGPU rendering
- Can handle complex meshes
- GitHub: https://github.com/Kitware/vtk-js

## Implementation Path

1. Start with BrainBrowser for quick prototype
2. Use FreeSurfer parcellation data for 40+ regions
3. Consider NiiVue for production build
4. Integrate Allen Brain Atlas data for accuracy

## Key Advantages Over Custom Three.js
- Pre-mapped brain regions
- Scientifically accurate coordinates
- Built-in interaction controls
- Standard neuroimaging format support
- Community-maintained accuracy

This would provide a much more accurate and detailed 3D brain visualization than building from scratch.
