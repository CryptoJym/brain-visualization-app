# Solutions for Repetitive Age Selection Issue

## Current Problem
- For each "YES" answer to trauma questions, users must select age periods
- With potentially 10+ trauma questions, this becomes very repetitive
- Users see "At what age(s) did this occur?" multiple times

## Proposed Solutions

### Option 1: Collect All Ages at the End
**Flow:**
1. Answer all 22 questions (YES/NO only)
2. At the end, show a summary: "You indicated these traumas occurred:"
3. For each trauma, select ages and frequency on one comprehensive screen

**Pros:**
- Much less repetitive
- Faster completion
- Can see all traumas in context

**Cons:**
- Might be overwhelming to see all traumas at once
- Less immediate connection between question and age

### Option 2: Group Similar Traumas
**Flow:**
1. After each category (Abuse, Neglect, Household), ask about ages for that group
2. "For the abuse-related traumas you experienced, when did these occur?"

**Pros:**
- Reduces repetition from 10+ times to 3-4 times
- Maintains some connection between trauma and timing

**Cons:**
- Still somewhat repetitive
- May conflate different traumas in same category

### Option 3: Smart Age Collection
**Flow:**
1. First YES answer: Ask about age periods
2. Subsequent YES answers: Ask "Did this also occur during ages [previously selected]?"
3. Only show full age selection if they indicate different ages

**Pros:**
- Adaptive based on user's pattern
- Reduces repetition for traumas that occurred in same period

**Cons:**
- More complex logic
- Assumes traumas occurred in same periods

### Option 4: Single Comprehensive Age Timeline
**Flow:**
1. Answer all questions first
2. Show one timeline: "Mark all periods when you experienced trauma"
3. Then for each marked period, ask which specific traumas occurred

**Pros:**
- Very efficient
- Visual timeline approach
- Only one age selection screen

**Cons:**
- Loses specificity of which trauma at which age
- May affect brain impact calculations

### Option 5: Optional Detailed Mode
**Flow:**
1. After first YES: "Would you like to specify ages for each trauma individually?"
2. If NO: Use a single age selection for all traumas
3. If YES: Continue with current detailed flow

**Pros:**
- User choice
- Can accommodate both preferences

**Cons:**
- Adds another decision point
- May confuse some users

## Recommendation
**Option 1 (Collect All Ages at the End)** would be the best balance of:
- Maintaining data accuracy
- Reducing repetition significantly  
- Keeping the assessment flow smooth
- Preserving the connection between specific traumas and ages

This would reduce age selection from potentially 10+ screens to just 1 comprehensive screen at the end.
