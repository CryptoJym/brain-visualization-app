# Brain Visualization App - Deployment Verification âœ…

## Environment Variables Status

All required environment variables have been successfully added to Vercel:

| Variable | Environments | Added | Status |
|----------|-------------|-------|---------|
| VITE_ANTHROPIC_API_KEY | Development, Preview, Production | 21h ago | âœ… Active |
| VITE_MEM0_API_KEY | Development, Preview, Production | 55m ago | âœ… Active |
| VITE_MEM0_ORG_ID | Development, Preview, Production | 54m ago | âœ… Active |

## Local Testing Results

### Mem0 API Connection Test
```
âœ… MemoryClient created
âœ… Memory added successfully!
âœ… Retrieved 1 memories
ðŸŽ‰ Mem0 is working correctly!
```

### Live Site Accessibility Test
```
âœ… Site is accessible
âœ… Home page loads successfully
âœ… Demo view loads successfully
âœ… Auth view loads successfully
```

## What Was Fixed

1. **MemoryClient Initialization**
   - Fixed: Removed unsupported `org_id` and `project_id` parameters
   - Now uses only `apiKey` parameter

2. **API Method Updates**
   - Fixed: Replaced broken `search()` method with `getAll()`
   - Fixed: Updated `add()` method to use correct format with messages array

3. **Environment Variables**
   - Added VITE_MEM0_API_KEY to all Vercel environments
   - Added VITE_MEM0_ORG_ID to all Vercel environments
   - Verified VITE_ANTHROPIC_API_KEY was already present

## How to Verify Everything Works

### Option 1: Browser Test
1. Open https://brain-visualization-app-vuplicity.vercel.app
2. Open Developer Tools (F12)
3. Click "Start Personalized Assessment"
4. Sign up with a test email (e.g., test@brainviz.app)
5. If signup succeeds, Mem0 is working âœ…
6. Complete assessment and choose "AI Conversation"
7. If chat loads, Anthropic is working âœ…

### Option 2: Test Page
1. Open the test page: `test-deployment-final.html` in your browser
2. Follow the guided tests
3. Check for any errors in the console

### Option 3: Console Test
Open the browser console on the live site and run:
```javascript
// This will check if environment variables are loaded
console.log('Mem0 configured:', !!import.meta.env.VITE_MEM0_API_KEY);
console.log('Anthropic configured:', !!import.meta.env.VITE_ANTHROPIC_API_KEY);
```

## Deployment Status

The application has been redeployed with all the necessary fixes and environment variables. The authentication system using Mem0 should now be fully functional on the live site.

Last deployment: ~1 hour ago (after adding environment variables)
