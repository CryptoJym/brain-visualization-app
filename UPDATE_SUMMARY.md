# Brain Visualization App - Major Updates

## Changes Based on Your Feedback

### 1. Removed Severity Calculations
- No more "8 ACEs = 8/10 severity" scaling
- Now simply counts total ACEs (can be >10 with expanded questions)
- Focus on which brain regions are affected, not arbitrary severity scores

### 2. Enhanced Questionnaire
- Added dropdown selectors for age ranges and duration (no more free text)
- Added 35+ total ACE questions including:
  - Life-threatening events (near-death experiences, being trapped)
  - Severe accidents (even without hospitalization)
  - Natural disasters
  - Witnessing death/severe injury
  - Chronic pain
  - Social isolation
  - Pet loss
  - And many more

### 3. Age-Specific Brain Impact
- Different ages affect different brain regions differently
- Early childhood (0-6): Foundational architecture
- Middle childhood (7-12): Social/cognitive systems
- Adolescence (13-18): Executive function/risk assessment
- Shows which ACEs occurred during which developmental periods

### 4. Results Display
- Shows total ACE count (not limited to 10)
- Lists affected brain regions with trauma count
- Displays developmental periods affected
- No severity scores - just facts about impacts

### 5. Brain Regions
- Added 40+ brain regions to the mapping system
- All regions have proper trauma impact associations
- Ready for proper 3D visualization

## Next Steps for 3D Visualization

### Open-Source Solutions Found:
1. **BrainBrowser** - Quick implementation with real brain meshes
2. **NiiVue** - Modern TypeScript medical viewer
3. **Allen Brain Atlas** - Comprehensive region data
4. **vtk.js** - High-performance scientific visualization

These libraries already have anatomically correct 3D brain models with all regions properly mapped, which would be much better than the current simplified Three.js spheres.

## Current Deployment
Your updated app is live at: https://brain-visualization-o962v6kjo-utlyze.vercel.app

The questionnaire now properly captures the full range of ACEs with appropriate selectors, and the analysis focuses on brain region impacts rather than severity scores.
